This code is written in Python and is using the Blender Python API to create 3D objects in a Blender scene. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. The code imports the bpy module, which is the main module for the Blender Python API.

2. The code then calls the bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add() function, which adds a mesh cube object to the current scene.

3. The code gets a reference to the newly created object by accessing the bpy.context.active_object property.

4. The code sets the location of the cube object to (0, 0, 0) using the object's location property.

5. The code sets the dimensions of the cube object to (1, 1, 1) using the object's dimensions property.

6. The code calls the bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add() function, which adds a mesh cube object to the current scene for the lid of the box.

7. The code gets a reference to the newly created object by accessing the bpy.context.active_object property.

8. The code sets the location of the lid object to (0, 0, 0,5) using the object's location property.

The code sets the dimensions of the lid object to (1.2, 1.2, 0.1) using the object's dimensions property.

9. The code sets the name of the cube object to "Box" using the object's name property.

10. The code sets the name of the plane object to "Lid" using the object's name property.

11. To duplicate the box, we only adjusted the dimension and the location of the box.
